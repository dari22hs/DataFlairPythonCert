# Modulus (%)

#* Relational Operators
# Equal to (=)
# Not equal to (!=)
# Greater than (>)
# Less than (<)
# Greater or equal (>=)
# Less or equal (<=)

#* Assignment Operators

#* Logical Operators
# and -> Returns True if all conditions are True
# or -> Returns True if AT LEAST ONE condition is True
# not -> Inverts an expression's Boolean value

#* Membership Operators
# in -> Returns True if the value is member of a sequence
# not in -> Returns True if the value is NOT member of a sequence

#* Identity Operators
# is -> Returns True if two objects are the same
# is not -> Returns True if two objects are different

#* Bitwise Operators
# Binary AND (&) -> 3&4 = 0 (011 & 100)
# Binary OR (|) -> 2|3 = 3 (10|11)
# Binary XOR (^) -> 2^3 = 1
# Binary One's Complement (~) -> ~-3 = 2
# Binary Left-Shift (<<) -> 2<<2 = 8 (1000)
# Binary Right-Shift (>>) -> 3>>1 = 1
